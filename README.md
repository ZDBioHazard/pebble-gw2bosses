GW2 Boss Timers Pebble Watchapp
---------------------------------
This is a [Pebble Smartwatch](http://getpebble.com) watchapp that displays
[world boss event](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/World_boss) timers for
[Guild Wars 2](http://guildwars2.com).

Installing
----------
You can either build this application yourself with the
[Pebble SDK](https://developer.getpebble.com), or install it from the Pebble
Marketplace on your phone. No set-up is required, so just start it up and away
you go! :)

Network Connection
------------------
This application does not require any kind of network connection to operate,
thus, it does not actually know if an event is already over or not, so make
sure to get to your events early!

While this application does not require an active Internet connection, it does
need to connect to your phone from time to time to fetch the current time zone.
This is a Pebble limitation.

Using This Application
----------------------
Just scroll up and down to see the next half-dozen events that are coming up.
I'm working on a reminder and checklist system for one of the next versions.

Limitations
-----------
This application assumes only one boss is active at a time, and considers the
active event over when the next event on the list starts. I'm working on a
more accurate table for one of the next versions, once I have time to do more
timing research.
