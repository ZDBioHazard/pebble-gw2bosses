GW2 Boss Timers Pebble Watchapp
---------------------------------
This is a [Pebble Smartwatch](http://getpebble.com) watchapp that displays
[world boss event](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/World_boss) timers for
[Guild Wars 2](http://guildwars2.com).

Installing
----------
You can either build this application yourself with the
[Pebble SDK](https://developer.getpebble.com), or install it from the Pebble
Marketplace on your phone. No set-up is required, so just start it up and away
you go! :)

Network Connection
------------------
This application does not require any kind of network connection to operate,
thus, it does not actually know if an event is already over or not, so make
sure to get to your events early!

While this application does not require an active Internet connection, it does
need to connect to your phone from time to time to fetch the current time zone.
This is a Pebble limitation.

Using This Application
----------------------
Scroll up and down to see the next world boss events that are coming up.
Press select to set a reminder for the selected event.

I'm working on a daily completion tracking system for one of the next versions.

Event Reminders
---------------
When you set a reminder for an event, your watch will vibrate at 10 and 5
minutes before, and at the event start.

Reminders are saved on exit, and you will be reminded for that same time slot
every day until you clear the reminder.

Because watch applications are unloaded from memory when you exit them, you
have to leave this application open for reminders to work.

Limitations
-----------
This application assumes only one boss is active at a time, and considers the
active event over when the next event on the list starts. I'm working on a
more accurate table for one of the next versions, once I have time to do more
timing research.
