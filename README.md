GW2 Boss Timers Pebble Watchapp
-------------------------------
This is a [Pebble Smartwatch](http://getpebble.com) watchapp that displays
[world boss event](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/World_boss) timers for
[Guild Wars 2](http://guildwars2.com).

Installation
------------
You can either build this application yourself with the
[Pebble SDK](https://developer.getpebble.com), or install it from the
[Pebble Marketplace](https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/5361b1a97ca4c8ba5e00003e).
([Direct link for phones](pebble://appstore/5361b1a97ca4c8ba5e00003e))

No configuration is required, so just start it up and away you go! :)

Using This Application
----------------------
Scroll up and down to see upcoming world boss events.

Press select to toggle a reminder for the selected event.

Network Connection
------------------
This application does not require an active Internet connection to operate.
Therefore, it does not actually know if an event is already over or not, so
make sure to get to your events at the appropriate times!

While this application does not require an active Internet connection, it does
need to connect to your phone from time to time to fetch the current time zone.
This is a Pebble limitation.

Event Reminders
---------------
When you set a reminder for an event, your watch will vibrate at 10 and 5
minutes before, and at the event start.

Reminders are saved on exit, and you will be reminded for that same time slot
every day until you clear the reminder.

Because watch applications are unloaded from memory when you exit them, you
have to leave this application open for reminders to work.

Limitations
-----------
This application assumes each event lasts 15 minutes, which is not the case
for all events.

If the watch time zone changes while the application is running, event times
may be incorrect. Simply restarting the app should fix this. This is a Pebble
limitation.
